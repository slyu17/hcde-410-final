## HCDE 410 Final Project

This project is designed learn about what people think of AI over the past few decades to see whether AI is actually benefiting and improving our society. The main motivation of this project is to find out: 

- **What are some perceptions on Articificial Intelligence from different perspectives?**
- **Does Artificial Intelligence influence human's lives in a positive way or negative way?**
- **Are poeple really getting convenience out of Artificial Intelligence Systems?**

Analyzing text over time can reveal trends and patterns in humans' beliefs, interest, and sentiment about Artificial Intelligence. This study focus on the views that expressed about artificial intelligence (AI) in the New York Times over the past 30-year period. The dataset I found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) presents a set of measures that captures levels of engagement, measures of pessimism and optimism, the prevalence of specific hopes and concerns, and topics that are linked to discussions about AI over decades. The dataset is originally querying the New York Times public API for metadata (e.g., title of article, section of paper, current URL).

**Dataset Indicators** 

`Impact on work (positive)`: AI makes human work easier or frees us from needing to work at all, e.g., by managing our schedules, automating chores via robots.

`Education`: AI improves how students learn, e.g., through automatic tutoring or grading, or providing other kinds of personalized analytics.

`Transportation`: AI enables new forms of transportation, e.g., self-driving cars, or advanced space travel.

`Healthcare`: AI enhances the health and well-being of people, e.g., by assisting with diagnosis, drug discovery, or enabling personalized medicine.

`Decision making`: AI or expert systems help us make bet- ter decisions, e.g., when to take a meeting, or case-based reasoning for business executives.

`Entertainment`: AI brings us joy through entertainment, e.g., though smarter enemies in video games.

`Singularity (positive)`: A potential singularity will bring positive benefits to humanity, e.g., immortality.

`Merging of human and AI (positive)`: Humans merge with AI in a positive way, e.g., robotic limbs for the disabled, positive discussions about potential rise of transhumanism.

`Impact on work (negative)`: AI displaces human jobs, e.g., large-scale loss of jobs by blue collar workers. Military applications: AI kills people or leads to instabil- ities and warfare through military applications, e.g., robotic soldiers, killer drones.

`Absence of Appropriate Ethics`: AI lacks ethical reasoning, leading to negative outcomes, e.g., loss of human life. Lack of progress: The field of AI is advancing more slowly than expected, e.g., unmet expectations like those that led to an AI Winter.

`Singularity (negative)`: The singularity harms humanity, e.g., humans are replaced or killed.

`Merging of human and AI (negative)`: Humans merge with AI in a negative way, e.g., cyborg soldiers.
