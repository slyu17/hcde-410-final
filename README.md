## HCDE 410 Final Project

This project is designed learn about what people think of AI over the past few decades to see whether AI is actually benefiting and improving our society. The main motivation of this project is to find out: 

- **What are some perceptions on Articificial Intelligence from different perspectives?**
- **Does Artificial Intelligence influence human's lives in a positive way or negative way?**
- **Are poeple really getting convenience out of Artificial Intelligence Systems?**

Analyzing text over time can reveal trends and patterns in humans' beliefs, interest, and sentiment about Artificial Intelligence. This study focus on the views that expressed about artificial intelligence (AI) in the New York Times over the past 30-year period. The dataset I found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) presents a set of measures that captures levels of engagement, measures of pessimism and optimism, the prevalence of specific hopes and concerns, and topics that are linked to discussions about AI over decades. The dataset is originally querying the New York Times public API for metadata (e.g., title of article, section of paper, current URL).
